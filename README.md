## Hello Visitors, Welcome to Aditya's Profile &nbsp;

I am Aditya Ranjan Jha (aka adiboy/ARJ). I am a first-year doctoral student pursuing research in computer engineering. 

I am interested in learning computer architecture and computer security, but I would like to be part of any discussion that revolves around computer engineering.ðŸ™‚

I am lucky to have graduated with the best peers and friends from IIT Kharagpur. A large bunch of my personal traits belong to that ecosystem.
